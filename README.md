# Telco Churn Analysis

This project aims to perform churn analysis on a Telco dataset to gain insights into customer churn behavior and develop strategies to mitigate churn. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription or services with a company, and it is crucial for businesses to understand the underlying factors and patterns associated with churn in order to retain customers and improve overall business performance.

## Dataset

The Telco Churn dataset used in this analysis contains information about Telco customers, including demographics, services subscribed, monthly charges, tenure, and whether the customer churned or not. The dataset is provided in CSV format and can be found in the `data` directory.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, converting data types, and performing feature engineering if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The data is explored to gain a better understanding of its distribution, identify any patterns, and uncover initial insights. Visualizations and statistical techniques are employed to summarize and interpret the data.

3. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are selected to build predictive models. Correlation analysis, feature importance, and domain knowledge are used to determine the most significant variables.

4. **Model Development**: Various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, are implemented to predict customer churn. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance and select the best-performing one.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The selected model's performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is validated to ensure its reliability and generalizability.

6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Based on the analysis results and the selected model, insights are drawn regarding the key factors influencing churn. Strategies and recommendations are proposed to reduce churn rates, improve customer retention, and enhance business profitability.
